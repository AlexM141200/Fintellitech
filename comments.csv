Amazon is a scummy company in every way.
"&gt;Of those injuries, 95 percent were those the organization considers serious either because Amazon had to temporarily reassign the worker to a less strenuous role or give them time off to recover.

more than just raw numbers this could speak to amazon having a lower thresh hold for these two modes of relief than many companies. I have my doubts but it's something worth asking."
Isn’t Amazon enormous? As in if it’s a colossal company it’s going to hire a huge amount of people and hence easily have the most injuries.
"""Activist investor Tulipshare is forcing another vote this year to push for an independent report on Amazon's warehouse safety after the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration found workplace safety violations in six warehouses across the country.

The report would detail the ""impact of (Amazon's) policies, management, performance metrics, and targets,"" Tulipshare's proposal said.""

&amp;#x200B;

Long overdue..."
"I heard from someone at OSHA that Amazon has led the United States in OSHA recordable incidents for almost 2 decades. They took the lead from Home Depot sometime around 2005.

This is all hearsay, so don't take my word for it."
Yes but your fighting Amazon.
Amazon is orders of magnitude worse.
"Maybe. I'm not a warehouse safety policy expert, so I don't know what actual safety policy differences there are at Amazon vs. other warehouses (and I don't expect to find a well researched or insightful answer on Engadget), but I would guess that volume/throughout or some other ""*warehouse activity*"" metric, as well as categories of warehoused product, would need to be taken into account to learn anything meaningful from the statistic.

There are lots of warehouses for lots of things, and many of them are probably quite slow. I imagine Amazon warehouses are running operations full speed constantly. It might be insightful to compare Amazon to Walmart for total volumes. It might also be insightful to compare Amazon to something like Home Depot or Grainger, as well as Kohl's or Levi. Since Amazon stocks *everything*, Amazon workers have to deal with moving and packing everything from pencils to lawnmowers."
" not surprising considering that 40% of all warehouse space in the us was owned by amazon in 2020.

(according to chatgpt)"
"That’s what a Amazon spokesperson would say! Nice try Amazon spokesperson. 

/s"
"Except the accident rate is 6.6 employees per hundred, ""more than double the rate seen at non-Amazon warehouses last year."""
"Amazon is built to drain all they can from their workers so this isn’t a surprise. What’s worse is they will do everything in their power to get out of medical care and send employees to only Amazon approved doctors. My friend has worked at Amazon for 10 years and it has ruined her body. She finally got surgery on her arm after years of pain from repetitive use and they put her on desk duty where they watch her like a hawk. She isn’t allowed a pillow to rest her arm on or anything to make herself comfortable and when she goes to the bathroom, managers will follow her and tell her to hurry up. It’s obvious they are trying to get rid of her. This on top of them forcing her to stay on the overnight shift which has messed up her sleep so much that she only gets two hours a night and has fallen asleep while driving while overall making her more prone to injuries on the job."
"See, what's frustrating is that ""double the rate of non-Amazon warehouses"" is just the correct statistic to look at. There's no reason to use a base-rate blind stat like ""half of all US injuries"" in a headline in the first place when the statistic that accurately conveys the situation sounds just as bad."
"https://i.imgur.com/WkPdj4R.jpg

This is my favorite graph to reply to that “acceptable rate” comment. Nearly double the rate of non-Amazon warehouses."
"&gt;**Leicabawse**

&gt;Amazon employ about half (750k) of the 1.3m warehouse staff in the US, so this seems a reasonable accident rate.

Could you cite sources for the employment numbers in your organic comment?

According to to the linked content:^1,2

&gt;Put another way, the SOC claims more than half of all serious US warehouse injuries in 2022 occured at Amazon, despite the company only employing 36 percent of all US warehouse workers last year.

"Excerpt from the linked content:^1,2

&gt;Nearly two years after Jeff Bezos said Amazon would spend $300 million to improve workplace safety, a coalition of labor unions claims the company was responsible for 53 percent of all serious warehouse injuries recorded in the US last year. 

&gt;In a report released on Wednesday (PDF link), the Strategic Organizing Center (SOC) said data collected by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) shows Amazon warehouse workers continue to suffer injuries more frequently than their non-Amazon counterparts. 

&gt;[SOC] also claims those injuries were often more severe.

&gt;In 2022, Amazon reported a total of 38,609 recordable injuries. Per the SOC, those are incidents that require a worker to either take time off from their regular job or seek medical treatment beyond first aid. 

&gt;Of those injuries, 95 percent were those the organization considers serious either because Amazon had to temporarily reassign the worker to a less strenuous role or give them time off to recover.

&gt;Put another way, the SOC claims more than half of all serious US warehouse injuries in 2022 occured at Amazon, despite the company only employing 36 percent of all US warehouse workers last year.

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Amazon disputes the Strategic Organizing Center’s interpretation of the data it shared with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 

&gt;Specifically, it takes issue with SOC’s use of “serious injury rate,” noting it’s not an official OSHA metric.

"Amazon employ about half (750k) of the 1.3m warehouse staff in the US, so this seems a reasonable accident rate."
"apple is the only major player that produces their products in china using child/slave labor. every year a ""new"" factory get's discovered and they use the amazon strategy of blaming the contractor. 

samsung does not produce in china."
"&gt; And then the cities agreed to remit a large portion of the collections back to Amazon, effectively reducing their sales tax to lower figures.

So the city is bringing in a lot of low-paying jobs that won't generate much tax revenue, and refunding other tax revenue that they are collecting.  And the people who live in this city are happy with that decision?  All of the problems, none of the benefits?"
"*“Probably less work and more pay than your current work though if you do it right”*

You would think right…. I have a colleague who’s currently doing the onlyfans thing. She’s extremely open about it, and had previously done print modeling to help with paying off her medical school loans. She switched to PRN work (as needed on call), because the amount of time and work required to keep her subscriber base is crazy. 

We talked about it since I was curious about the financial side of things, and she said that 16-20 hour days were not uncommon (much like our current occupation). Between making, editing and posting new content to engaging with the subscribers and then advertising in places like Reddit and on certain forums it was just as stressful as a day at the hospital. However, she’s making four to five times more a month and can just enjoy a day off if she chose to. She’s paid off her house first (to be able to lessen her insurance coverage which has been crazy here for the past two years) and then started hitting her school debts.

She’s an average girl next door type, but engages with her subscribers and offers package deals for purchase where you can order up what you’re in to. The amount of packages she gets from Amazon to the mailbox place (not located in her same town by the way) is ridiculous. It got so bad over the holiday season that the mailbox place had to set scheduled pickup’s near closing so they could help load the stuff and get it out of their care.

I helped on a few of these runs, and it’s crazy the amount of money some people will spend on “gifts”. It’s also become a nightmare for her as well and she’s had to literally take classes on state and federal tax law to understand what she’s liable for to claim and what is truly a “gift”. I envy the increase in financial freedom, but not the responsibility of the work."
"Apple has a pretty bad reputation in the tech world from workers. Of the Faangs they pay the least and only are a step above Amazon in grinding you into the ground. 

It is very short term thinking if that is the case."
"What about those looped NLM systems like Auto-GPT or babyAGI?  
Where you, in principle, feed a chat AI a prompt like:

&gt;Your goals are:  
1. Find a near future event  
2. Create a fitting greeting card  
3. Send it to \[...\]  
4. Shut down  
You can do the following:  
Create a subgoal, perform an action \[list of plugins/actions\]  
What do you recommend?

Then you parse the response, perform actions, enrich the prompt with the result all automated and repeat until it thinks the task is accomplished. I could see something like that request to make a Amazon Mechanical Turk account to solve captchas.

Check them out if you haven't already, they seem like a promising or at least interesting road towards automated indepentend AIs.

"""The titanic was unsinkable before it sank junior. That's why I ask how old you are""

No. The titanic was completely sinkable, however it was quite difficult and would require flooding multiple compartments to flood, which was unlikely. Therefore, some people made the claim it was unsinkable.

&gt; Meanwhile a nuclear power plant using a modern design simply cannot melt down. It’s impossible. You cannot even if you try.

A modern nuclear power CANNOT MELT DOWN BY DESIGN. There is no ONE IN A TRILLION CHANCE THAT IT HAPPENS, it's physically impossible. It cannot happen. It's fail SAFE. No amount of human or technical error can cause something that physically cannot happen.

&gt; Edit: even google server aren't up 100% of time. It has downtime. Amazon too, ebay too... why is a nuclear power plant different?

Because a technical error is able to cause that......? A server can crash, as there is no crash proof design. A server cannot fly however, as the design does not allow it to fly. And no amount of human or technical failure is going to make a server fly."
"Interesting. Amazon made similar deals with cities in the California Central Valley such that by locating their warehouses there the sales tax would be assigned to those cities. And then the cities agreed to remit a large portion of the collections back to Amazon, effectively reducing their sales tax to lower figures.

It was part of their move into California after fighting for so many years to not be part of the state so they didn't have to charge sales tax on sales into the state.

If this stuff changed, I wonder what triggered it? Or were the agreements to allocate the sales taxes to certain cities illegal all along? Seems like this stuff will go to court soon (suits by cities without such agreements if nothing else) and we'll find out a lot more."
The ironic thing is that I hear from Amazon friends that they go into the office only to do Zoom meetings with colleagues either at other locations or with folks working from home that day. No real in person collaboration
At least Amazon does something useful. The world would be better off without Facebook (I refuse to use their rebranded name a la Comcast that has a sole purpose of deflecting from the fact that nobody likes them).
Amazon reviews should apply to only the product in the listing.  Amazon allows these bizarre conglomerations of reviews and listings where you buy a keyboard and the reviews are for a scented candle.
"Still currently happening, look at Amazon with their robotic storage facilities"
"Good points. Yeah it is wild how absent minded people can get at work sometimes but in those cases changes are made to help the next person sort of in a zombie state.

Underreporting is a problem with everyone including Amazon because it is self reported and has to be in most cases, but especially with smaller warehouses because they'll give people nudges to not mention it or get out of OSHA reporting since it can harm smaller operations more than big ones. 

&gt; Federal inspectors have repeatedly levied fines against the company at several facilities over various safety violations. OSHA cited Amazon [at six of](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/01/amazon-cited-by-osha-again-over-warehouse-injuries.html) its warehouses [for failing to report](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/18/amazon-cited-by-osha-for-exposing-warehouse-workers-to-safety-hazards.html) workplace injuries and exposing workers to ergonomic hazards.

Also, since Amazon is so huge and so many workers, the sheer numbers will probably be higher due to more people, equipment, buildings etc.

All eyes are on Amazon and they were under attack by foreign competitors and even the Trump admin so they really had to tighten it up. But OSHA is good and people deserve not to be run to the ground, where that is happening companies need to chill and scale up.

In the end I just can't believe if we took Amazon and Walmart for instance, that at a relative comparison they aren't pretty close to the same numbers. If they are still double at Amazon then something is wrong, but again it goes back to their scale and the self reporting aspect, very hard to tell the actual situation. 

Usually self reporting style tends to make the safer ones that do report look worse. It happens in many industries where self reporting for any reason is relied on."
"Yes, and the vast majority give almost as few shits about Americans being scammed. The fact that you're doubling down on the idea that we should send Amazon to foreign countries to change their laws shows an absolutely astonishing level of ignorance on your part. Why stop there? Let's force Amazon and Apple to do something about the Taliban while we are at it. 

Delete your post you waste of space. You're a walking personification of the failure of our education system."
"You do realize that Amazon and Apple both no longer even do business in Russia, right? 

I swear to God people like you need to be stamped out of the conversation. You make us look like absolute morons by association.The adults are trying to come up with real solutions, stop adding noise to the conversation."
"The ease with which apple or amazon get laws changed aside, they can just stop offering easy-to-scam-with gift cards.

You're really not very bright or imaginative.

If you make the powerful people responsible for the crime they're facitating, they will stop."
"True.  Netflix is completely toast thanks to apple and HBO. 

Amazon is successful but is hated for being an evil company that abuses its employees. 

Google was great but suffers under the current leadership.  Maybe when the original founders leave a company the company loses its soul and becomes a shadow of its former self until a new evangelist comes and rescues it.   Just like jobs did with apple. Or Elon musk (for better or worse) with Titter."

"I manage a warehouse (not Amazon). We don't underreport anything. But it amazes me how often my employees find ways to injure themselves despite all of the steps we take. 

Usually its because they continually ignore PPE requirements and I haven't had a chance to fire them for it yet."
"Easy. The last person holding the money in your jurisdictiction is liable for the costs incurred on the victim.

If apple or amazon or steam or western union had to refund that shit they'd figure out how to stop it overnight.

Similarly fine the last person in the chain of communication in your jurisdiction $50 per scam call (with $10 going to the one that reported it)."
"Amazon are slave drivers at every level. People aren't pissing in bottles because they want to, they have to in order to meet these quotas, and if you meet the quota is goes up next month, and so on. Don't like it? Well, there's no union so they just replace you and find someone willing to break their back to meet the quota.

I'm not surprised having people work at 110% leads to more accidents and injuries."
Why am I truly not surprised? There was an article a couple of years ago that revealed emergency medical services were called to Amazon facilities much more frequently than the average.
"Yeah I'll bet other warehouses underreport as well. 

No way the processes at Amazon and Walmart warehouses are that different to have a 2x disparity. That seems manipulated."
"'Drowsiness detection' is a possible reason. - More likely Tesla wanted liability in the case of an accident - proving that Autopilot wasn't engaged, or the driver was doing something they shouldn't have. 

Amazon records inside their vehicles, only turns off when you are on break. It is said AI is the only one that sees inside the cabin, and the company is unable to pull real time footage - only in the case of an accident. - But that is a company vehicle, while you are on the job.

Automakers - have been becoming more and more, you rent our vehicle, even though you bought it. Tesla being at the forefront of this. However, every manufacturer has been IP/DRM locking you out from repairing your own vehicle from Ford -&gt; BMW everyone has been doing this in one way or another. Just like a John Deere tractor - locked out from repairs via IP and DRM. (Intellectual Property/Digital Rights Management.) - Sad really."

"I wonder the reason for this? I had a family members, friends, and acquaintances work at an Amazon warehouse pulling orders and I've worked in warehouses. Based on conversations the Amazon warehouses seemed to operate safer than any warehouse I've ever worked at. 

I wonder if because of Amazon's larger profile if they have a larger labor pool to hire from and they're hiring the wrong types of people for that work? I often meet people that say they work at the Amazon warehouse and I'm a little shocked they work in a warehouse."
"This has been the story for years and they’re still ramping up hard. Unlike other OEMs, Tesla’s biggest advantage is their margins. They can easily cut prices like they’ve been doing and still be profitable. Meanwhile OEMs are losing money on every car they sale. It’ll take them a few more years to be profitable because they move slow af. By then it might be too late.

Expect a lot of OEMs to go under or combine together (unless the gov bails them out).

I do think Tesla’s brand has suffered a little due to Elon but not enough to make a dent. At the end of the day people still buy from Amazon even though they hate Bezon. People are still on FB/IG even with Zuckerberg. A compelling product sells no matter who’s their CEO. 

On another note, Tesla’s cars are just 1 part of their business. Expect the other ones to ramp up soon so trust me, they’ll be fine."

"Depends on what the restocking fee is. I was once charged 20% in addition to shipping fees, which amounted to over $60 for a restocking fee from a third party seller. It did not cost them nearly that in time to send the item, and it makes zero sense to me that they should get a fee as a percentage of the cost of the item. A small, flat fee in addition to shipping is fine for online order returns, IMO.

I won’t buy 3rd party anymore on Amazon because of this, only prime. And if returns become difficult with arbitrary restocking fees, I’ll simply take my business elsewhere. Sometimes you need to return an item for various reasons, and a brick and mortar store would never charge you a fee to do so."
Amazon is turning into wish haha
Doesn't Amazon also have access to everyone's Ring video? I remember reading about Amazon allowing law enforcement access to customers Ring video without owner consent.
I didn’t say they aren’t available. I’m saying automation support contracts are standard to have 24/7 support. You need to think of this in the way of a factory. If ford require 24/7 then they require 24/7 supports. If Amazon runs 24/7 then they require 24/7 support. But do you know how they supplement the 24/7 remote support? By having on-site maintenance. It is my job to design and program automation equipment. This includes reading over or creating the supports contracts. I do this every day.
"&gt;But WHY THE F EVERYONE just rolled over and did not question cameras in a car 24/7 IS OK?

Because people are incredibly stupid. For a while Amazon was selling a camera that was marketed to be put in your bedroom, so you can easily take pictures while you change your clothes.

It sold well.

Ring (Amazon company) routinely gives away footage of oyur cameras to Police and store them unecrypted.

I bet all my fortne (and it's in 6 digits) that Ring employees are watching this shit."

3/3 sets of bass guitar strings I’ve purchased off Amazon had someone’s old used ones in the pack. All went back and were surely resold to someone else.
"You know i am amazed. I am not about conspiracies but some things like my privacy i do care about.

There have been numerous moments in history where people said 'what if they use it to spy and/or collect data'. Like with the public cameras, like with scanners in airports for facial recognition. Facial recognition in stores (example amazon stores).

But WHY THE F EVERYONE just rolled over and did not question cameras in a car 24/7 IS OK?

Are we stupid enough that for 'drowsiness detection' reason and 'for our own good' (especially in suposedly self driving cars) we agreed to be recorded 24/7?

How come this discussion is  'o no tesla is recording us' and not  'car companies are recording you and using your data and it's normalised'?"
"Ordered OEM car parts. Received clearly used parts someone switched out with new ones and returned. Then Amazon resold as new. 

Vinyl records keep getting shipped in bags. Most of the time they arrive beat to hell."
Like Google  and Amazon snoop for your data.  It's a matter of time that tesla and other makes snoop your in car conversations and where you drive to.
I'm pretty sure Amazon would have a 0.001% revenue drop and call it a crisis...
"I love the reviews that give the product a crappy rating because it arrived damaged, as if it's somehow the company who made the product's fault, and not Amazon or UPS..."
"I've said it before, and I'll say it again... If Amazon would be more picky with their vendors and actually hold them accountable for constantly misleading customers, there would be much fewer returns, costing them less money. 99% of the time I and anyone else I know returns something, it's because it was misrepresented on the product page and all the reviews were faked."

It’s durable and it works as advertised. The only problem is that during the hot summer days it gets incredibly hot inside."
"If there’s any company that can easily absorb the cost of returns, it’s Amazon; I would hardly call this a crisis for a multibillion dollar company whose market cap is just over $1 trillion. The real “crisis” story should be how terribly Amazon treats their employees, and how little they’re compensated for the abuse they endure."
"Yeah so far my returns include:
* A product with a known+dangerous manufacturing defect, that they're still selling. Likely not legal or certified to sell here in the first place
* Product that was not what was in the listing or on the box
* Product that was my what was listed
* Product that the vendor decided not to honor the warranty on (good on Amazon for doing so despite being past the 30 days)

2/4 not as described ain't great though"
It’s not an Amazon problem. All big companies are requiring return to office. I believe it has something to do with downtown areas loosing money aka companies are receiving an incentive to get people to spend money in office locations
"Now how about resurrecting great cancelled shows from Netflix, Amazon and Hulu?"
"Interesting that they're calling this a ""crisis."" They've been slowly degrading their return process for a couple years now, so I can't say I'm surprised. Coming soon! Amazon: Where you buy some unseen Chinese knockoff, then can't return it.

Meanwhile Costco, Target and Lowe's have all really upped their delivery game. Some local stores are starting to show signs of life again. Amazon is rapidly becoming my last resort"
Amazon also is starting to make you buy $100+ in groceries in order to deliver for Amazon Fresh (on top of your annual subscription).
"I don't mind paying a restock fee to a legitimate seller or business, but when even Amazon itself often sells people returned or blatantly used items, let them eat it."
